		<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
		<p>Here at Powam, we also want to hear from you. So we opened this submission portal so you can send us your thoughts, opinions, and news to get posted on our website. Think of it like an op-ed or letters to the editor if you would. So if you are part of our community and want to share your knowledge or opinons with the rest of us, feel free to send us what you wrote to possibly see it posted up on our website.</p>
		<p>Please read the following guidelines carefully to ensure that your submission has a chance of ending up on our page. Any violation of the guidelines will disqualify your submission from being posted.</p>
		<p>If you want to look at older submissions that have been placed in our archives, scroll to the bottom of the page to find them.</p>
		<br>
	
</div>
<div class="guidelinesList">
	<br>
	<p>Your submission must...</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Be written by the name it is being submitted with. Do not plagorize someone else's work! The only exception is the use of pseudonyms.</li>
		<li>Be written in English. While we appreciate that not everyone who comes to this site might be comfortable expressing themselves in English, we currently don't employ translator and cannot read your submission. If we can't read it, we don't post it.</li>
		<li>Not express hateful language such as racist or sexist words or themes</li>
		<li>Not express excessively graphic imagery</li>
		<li>Not disclose proprietary secrets. If you found the information out illegally, like Nintendo is releasing a Princess Peach platform game where you play and Peach and have bubble powers, we do not want to know. We do not put illegal things on our website and this would be a breach of copyright. Nintendo or Blizzard or anyone else is not going to hesitate to sue us, please don't put us in that position.</li>
		<li>Disclose potential trigger warnings. Not joking, if your writing contains material that might cause someone great emotional discomfort like mentions of assault or serious illness you must disclose this to staff before we find out by reading your material.</li>
		<li>Disclose spoiler warnings if they apply.</li>
		<li>Focus on some aspect of videogames, whether this is regarding the new department head switch at Nintendo, how you feel about a certain gaming console, or your opinions on a specific game. It must be related in some substantial way to videogames. Reviews of games or consoles are acceptable.
		</li>
		<li>Not be just an incoherent mess. While we all need to express our outrage at there not being a sequal to Golden Sun: Dark Dawn, this is not the place to do so if you can't rage in a readable manner. So just saying it's upsetting isn't going to cut it, try explaining why in half a page then get back to us.</li>
		<li>Submission file must not exceed 10 KB and be formated as either a google doc, word doc, or pdf. Otherwise our submission program fails and we can't see what you had to say.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Your submission can...</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Be short. You don't need to write a novel for us to accept it. Try shooting for around half a page of typed text, roughly size 12 or 14 font.
		</li>
		<li>Contain swearing and unpleasant themes, however remember the above rules and don't make anything too graphic or forget warnings.</li>
		<li>Be written in different formats. While we aren't the platform for experimental writting forms, if you want to write your piece as a letter instead of a traditional news article or use first person instead of third person narration, go right ahead.</li>
		<li>Be as geeky as you want it to be.</li>
		<li>Include references to big names like Nintendo and Blizzard or smaller brands.</li>
	</ul>

	<p id = "article2">Big news for all fans of the PAX conventions. Just recently it was announced by the conventions organizers that PAX East, West, and Unplugged are planned and scheduled to continue in 2021 as long as health conditions continue to improve. They are to be held in the same places as usual with most of the same schedule time except for PAX East which is usually held in March and seems to be pushed back closer to the summer months. As for other PAX conventions such as PAX Australia, the final decision for whether this will be held in the upcoming year is still unknown and likley to be released in the coming week. The only convention that is garentueed not to be held this coming year is PAX South which was cancelled for 2021, but is promised to be held the year after in 2022.</p>

<h4><u>Opinion Pieces</u></h4>
<div class="archives">
	<button onclick="showArticle3()">RPGs Deserve Advertisement Too</button>
	<p id = "article3">Let's just say it, a lot of the games on the market that get the full promotion gambit, aren't RPGs. The ones you always see on tv are the Call of Duties, the Mario Karts, Kirby's Epic Yarn. The videogames like Seneca's Sacrifice which are heavily invested in the story and incorporate it into the very levels and stages of the game aren't really popular with advertisers it would seem. And why is that? One could argue that with the more guided play and structured entertainment it would be something that could hook in new players more easily and expand the gaming community readily to new players as well as causal players who don't have the time for in-real-time games. However, the general consensus among game makers seems to be that the real money makers are games that have limited story and focuse on level systems like the earlier examples. This probably comes from the gaming community's love of franchises and squels. As such many companies might look at games with intense stories integral to their play and continuing into its sequals as potential loses as it would discourage new players who don't have the knowledge from playing the first game from picking up later installments. However, I really feel that the gaming community is missing out because of this and should really work to put its resources behind more new RPG games.</p>

<div class="archives">
	<button onclick="showArticle4()">You Should Appreciate Golden Sun: Dark Dawn</button>
	<p id = "article4">Look, I'm not the biggest gamer, but I will tell you that everyone should have the opportunity to play at least this one game. Golden Sun: Dark Dawn. Technically a next generation sequal for the previous DS game series Gold Sun, this game picks up with the children of the previous game's protagonists and quickly removes them from their parents and throws them head first into a mission to save the world from mysterious black holes that are popping up all over. While it might not be the most excessive twists and turns or overly complicated puzzles, this is a strong video game that does not get its due. The story, while a little generic, is incredibly investing, especially given the cliffhanger at the end of the game that leaves you questioning what will happen next. On top of that the game has fun game play dynamics with solid usage of the DS's control system and the usage of dijn as companions for your protagionsts that give them new and exciting magic abilities that can be used inside and outside of battle to solve problems. Lastly, the graphics are absolutely gorgeous, especially for the time it came out. All in all, this is an incredibly solid video game as a whole and a wonderful entry level RPG for any gamers thinking about trying out the genre. Thus it deserves a lot more love from the community and you should all go out and try the game. Who knows, maybe we'll finally get that squel with all the answers to our questions if you do.</p>
